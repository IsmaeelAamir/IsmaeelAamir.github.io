      <h3>Ismaeel Aamir</h3>
      <p> My name is Ismaeel Aamir, and I am a student at City, University of London. I study Computer science
	  and I am interested in Artificial Intelligence. I have programmed previously with python quite a bit, but
	  this is the first time I have used Java. My previous knowledge of programming in python has allowed me 
	  to progress through the bootcamp fairly easily. I look forward to the new skills and experiences that 
	  City will give me.</p>

    <h3>Bootcamp 2020: Project</h3>
    <p>
	My project is a fun little game where you use a small blue ball to pop the green balls, 
	whilst avoiding the red balls. Once all of the green balls have been popped, you win 
	and can play another round. The size, position and ratio of red to green balls is random.
	This project makes particular use of arrays, loops and randomness. An array is used to store
	data about each ball, and a loop is used to populate the array, with random values for the size, 
	positon and colour. 
	The ball bounces off of the walls, and also bounces off the red balls. But if you hit a red ball, you
	lose a life, out of five lives. When the ball bounces off these objects, or pops a green ball, a noise is played.
